A clean & classy HTML5, CSS3 framework that helps you to get your project up and running as fast as possible and helps prevent repetitive tasks.

Workless started out as a mashup of all the great things I liked about Twitter Bootstrap and HTML5Boilerplate. The more I worked with with it, the more I added in order to make life easier when working on any project.

It's now pretty much turned into a framework in it's own right, with all the stuff you need and none of the stuff you don't. It's about saving time and keeping your projects DRY.
